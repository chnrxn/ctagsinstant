Welcome to ctags-instant.

This is a web-interface that allows you to search through identifiers
in your source code.  Currently, tags are generated using ctags;
support for other tag generators like GNU/Global will be added later.

This is just a proof of concept app, and I would not consider this a
well written software by any standards.  Please use this with
caution. :)

You'll need the following programs:
  * Exuberant ctags: http://ctags.sourceforge.net
